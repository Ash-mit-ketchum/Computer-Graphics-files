the files have been written and created in codeblocks for its simplicity with the TDM GNU GCC 32bit compiler since minGW was being weird due to compatibility issues with the graphics.h header.
the files use the default C++ extension(.cpp) due to the compiler being originally created for C++, but all the code has been written in C itself.
